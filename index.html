			<h1 class="center">&lt; the beginning &gt;</h1>

			<p>Like most children, I had a lot of ideas about my future profession.</p>
			
			<aside>

				<h4>Things to be when I grow up:</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>Actress</li>
					<li>Pianist*</li>
					<li>Doctor</li>
					<li>Horse Trainer</li>
					<li>Teacher*</li>
					<li>Astronaut</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p id="special">*These jobs are the only ones that have made me any $$ so far.</p>

			</aside>

			<p>While <del>some</del> most of my interests have changed since then, I still believe that my ideal career incorporates 3 things: creativity, problem solving, and helping others.  I've tried out several paths so far, and have picked up some skills that I'm proud of along the way.  My next step is pursuing a career in programming.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed these jobs!  They allowed me to work with both children and adults, to travel to Eastern Europe and North Africa, and taught me some valuable communication and cross-cultural skills.  One of the major lessons I took from these jobs was that I find great joy in helping people improve their lives, even in small ways.</p>

			<p>This job seemed like a great fit for me:  I was able to continue the work of training, and was given the opportunity to design a curriculum from scratch.  It was slightly different from my previous experience in that most of the training centered around how to use various pieces of software.  I quickly realized that a lot of the workflow problems I saw were caused by quirks or gaps in the programs we were using.  These were problems that no amount of training could fix, and that really bothered me.</p>  

			<p>At this point, I also became interested in coding as a career.  I spent a lot of my free time learning via Codecademy and freeCodeCamp, but found it difficult to progress quickly while working full-time and commuting 3 hours a day.  So, I made a big decision: I saved some money and quit my job to pursue coding full time.</p>

			<p>That pretty much brings us to today.  I'm currently studying web development through LaunchCode's LC101 course.  We've also covered a bit of python and will be tackling the back-end later this summer.  In my free time, I'm continuing to work on front-end projects and test my Javascript knowledge through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/">freeCodeCamp</a>, and I'm acting as a team lead for an international bunch of developers and devs-in-training through a group called <a href="https://tropicalchancer.github.io/projectus/">Chingu Cohorts</a>.  You can see some of the projects members have built over the past few months <a href="https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/Chingu-dev-adventures">here</a>.

			<p>In summary:  It's taken me a while to get to this point, but I'm more certain than ever that a career in programming is in my future; I'm committed to doing everything I can to reach that goal.</p>
